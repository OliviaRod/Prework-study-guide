# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a bootcamp student I wanted a site where I can have my notes for class listed and displayed clearly. It solves the problem of having hand written notes that can be sloppy and are at risk of being lost in my room.

This Prework Study Guide was created for boot camp students who were going through the Prework. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
